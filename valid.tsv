The sarcoma has a mixed malignant spindled cell, as well as, osteo-chondrosarcomatous component. Highly pleomorphic malignant spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells are present. There are scattered foci of necrosis and calcification. Although most of the tumour expands the pericolic fat, the tumour focally infiltrates the outer layers of the muscularis propria (blockA6). The overlying mucosa and submucosa appear unremarkable. The bowel surgical margins appear clear of tumour, although there is a tumour nodule within the pericolic adipose tissue, 6mm from one margin. Eight separate deposits are also seen in the surrounding pericolic fat.	PHI:Null

The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of complex, crowded glands with variably desmoplastic stroma lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGO architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). Very occasional foci of solid growth are seen but these comprise less than 5%. The adenocarcinoma infiltrates into the outer half of the uterine wall with a maximum depth of invasion 20mm, through a wall 27mm thick (block 24). There is no convincing lymphovascular space invasion or serosal involvement.The presence of multiple benign leiomyomas is confirmed. The cervix and bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant histologic abnormality.	PHI:Null

1055	3297	A & B.  Sections show a predominantly unencapsulated tumour with no definite connection to adjacent adrenal gland. The tumour shows variable cellularity in which the great majority of cells have an oncocytic appearance with abundant granular pink cytoplasm.  In less cellular areas tumour cells are separated by mucin or oedema fluid. The tumour cells are arranged in small acinar and trabecular formations with an intervening fine vascular network.  Adipose tissue focally surrounds the tumour however deposits of adipose tissue are also seen within the tumour.  Numerous thick walled blood vessels are present.  No convincing spindle cell component is seen.  Although focally some of the tumour cells show bizarre nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses are extremely rare and the Ki67 index is less than 1%.  In two representative sections (blocks B15 & B16) the oncocytic tumour cells blend with cells which appear adrenocortical in nature with abundant multivacuolated clear cytoplasm.  Focally the diathermied resection margin transects the tumour.	PHI:Null
1055	3578	The tumour cells show strong positive staining with vimentin and CD10.  There is moderate staining with NSE and patchy staining with MelanA, PanCK and AE1/3. The EMA, calretinin, inhibin, HMB-45, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CK7, CK20, C-kit, Hepar-1 and SMA stains are negative.	PHI:Null
1055	3587	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1055	4228	The differential diagnosis in this case includes an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm, epithelioid angiomyolipoma and renal oncocytoma.  The latter is discounted on clinical grounds (not related to adjacentkidney).  Although the tumour contains adipose tissue and thick walled blood vessels, there is insufficient immunohistochemical evidence for an angiomyolipoma. The favoured diagnosis in this case is an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm and due to the size, the tumour would be classified as having borderline malignant potential (Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria).Due to the unusual nature of this tumour a second opinion will be sought.

1055	4523	"Thank you for the opportunity to see the slides from this case.	PHI:Null
1055	4992	As you know large adrenal cortical lesions with oncocytic cytologic features are a very problematic and evolving area in pathology. It is clear that theWeiss criteria cannot be applied without modification to oncocytic lesions, therefore other systems such as the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia system (LWB) have been proposed as has the reticulin algorithm. The reason why so many systems have been proposed is that none have been proven to be completely sensitive and specific.	PHI:Null
1055	5581	Despite its very low mitotic rate and proliferative activity, this adrenal cortical tumour displays several worrying features. Firstly there is quite prominent myxoid change. Myxoid change is not definitive, but is a feature which is suggestive of malignancy as it occurs only very rarely in clinically benign disease (Ref: Am J Surg Pathol 2010, pp973-983). Secondly the tumour is very large. Thirdly the tumour displays a worrying growth pattern including some pseudoglandular areas (another feature which is not definitive but occurs more commonly in malignancies than benign tumours).	PHI:Null
1055	5652	We have performed additional Immunohistochemistry which is as follows;	PHI:Null
1055	5737	Glucocorticoid receptor: Diffuse strong nuclear expression (glucocorticoid score 4+)	PHI:Null
1055	5783	IGF2: Positive (perinuclear dot-like pattern)	PHI:Null
1055	6331	We and others have found IGF2 expression to be a very useful marker of adrenal cortical carcinoma and particular useful in identifying tumours with a low proliferative rate (Ref: Endocrine Related Cancer 2009, pp573-583).We have also recently reported that the glucocorticoid receptor over-expressionis a strong marker of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma (Ref; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 2009, pp4591-4599)- but this finding isyet to be confirmed prospectively or by another group and so should be considered preliminary.	PHI:Null
1055	6605	Therefore on the basis of the very large size of the tumour, the presence of myxoid and pseudoglandular change, and the presence of strong positive staining for both IGF2 and glucocorticoid receptor, I favour this as adrenal cortical carcinoma of myxoid and oncocytic type.	PHI:Null
1055	6737	I emphasise that the mitotic rate is low as is the Ki67 proliferative index (<1%). Therefore the tumour is classified as low-grade.	PHI:Null

1057	3544	The excision specimen of this low grade myxoid lesion remains difficult. I am still uncertain how to classify this hypo-cellular fibro myxoid lesion within fatty tissue. It is essentially circumscribed and includes hyalinised collagenous areas with scattered non atypical spindle shaped cells and interspersed myxoid areas.	PHI:Null
1057	3763	Within the latter are spindle shaped cells but focally are some multi vacuolated lipoblast-like cells. There is some form of vascularity in thestroma but this is not uniform as it typically seen in myxoid liposarcomas.	PHI:Null
1057	3859	Our immunostains show some positivity for S100. Immunostains for Muc-4 and EMA appear negative.	PHI:Null
1057	4316	I am not certain of the diagnosis.Possibilities I considered were a well differentiated liposarcoma with myxoid areas, an unusual myxoid liposarcoma, a chondroid lipoma, a cellular myxoma and a low grade fibro myxoid sarcoma. The negative MUC4 immunostain is against thelatter. The absence of MDM2 amplification on FISH (please see Prof K'Eberling comment below) is against a well differentiated liposarcoma. Further FISH analysis (DDIT3 & FUS) is pending.	DOCTOR:K'Eberling

1058	2563	The left anterior thigh tumour is a myxoid liposarcoma. The tumour is partially encapsulated and consists of lobules of chondromyxoid stroma containing atypical adipocytes and lipoblasts, a chicken-wire network of thin walled vessels and scattered pseudolymphangioma-like spaces. Broad areas of necrosis (macroscopically involving 20%) and a prominent foreign body type giant cell reaction are present, and may represent effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Two reactive lymph nodes are identified. Sections of the saphenous vein show no significant histologic abnormality. No evidence of round cell component or high grade dedifferentiation is seen.

1059	3925	A.  Sections show a biphasic synovial sarcoma which is partly cystic and partly solid.  Most of the solid component has an appearance similar to the previous core biopsy (19A88853).  This comprises mainly spindle cells in short irregularfascicles and also admixed more epithelioid cells forming palisades and occasional poorly formed gland-like structures. The tumour cells have elongated and oval nuclei with fine chromatin, generally small nucleoli and scanty, poorly defined eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is also a minor component, around 20% of the tumour sampled, where there is very obvious formation of well formed glands lined by columnar cells, with intervening spindle cell tumour.  The tumour cysts are generally surrounded by a thin rim of solid tumour and are lined by spindled tumour cells.  There are scattered foci of calcification within the tumour.  Mitoses number up toaround 8 per 10 high power fields.  No necrosis is seen.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  There is some patchy collagenous and myxoid fibrosis adjacent to the tumour, particularly inferiorly, and this presumably represents tumour which has now regressed due to chemotherapy.  However this fibrosis is not particularly prominent and all the tumour identified macroscopically appears to be viable histologically.	IDNUM:19A88853\nDATE:now=>2013-05-01

1060	8222	As you rightly say, both lesions have similar morphologic features, being characterised by an acinar-type or papillary proliferation of plump epithelioid cells with palely eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and relatively uniform and only mildly atypical vesicular nuclei.  While some areasof the lesion do indeed bear an architectural resemblance to myxopapillary ependymoma, the bulk of the lesion has much more epithelioid morphology than one would expect in that context.  Immunostains in our hands show strong positivity not only for S100 protein but also for GFAP along with scattered cells positive EMA and rare cells positive for keratin CAM 5.2, while stains for pan keratin, p63, TFE-2 and Olig 2 are negative.  Staining for INI-1 is positive, ie. normal/retained.  I believe that the cytoarchitectural features and immunophenotype would fit best with myoepithelial carcinoma, low grade. The presence of two distinct masses is very worrisome and clearly raises the possibility of this representing metastasis from elsewhere, unless perhaps one of these lesions represents a locoregional metastasis from the other.  Only ongoing clinical correlation will help to address this question.  I would be very interested to hear of future developments in this unusual case".	PHI:Null

1061	3964	A &B.  Sections show a relatively well circumscribed tumour within deep soft tissue.  The tumour comprises of a mixture of spindle cells, round to oval cells and multinucleated giant cells.  There is marked cytological atypia and nuclear pleomorphism.  There is brisk mitotic activity.  Focal areas of prominent stromal hyalinisation and coagulative necrosis are present.  Numerous tumour giant cells are present throughout the tumour.  Some of the giant cells are osteoclastic-like.  The tumour infiltrates into the surrounding adipose tissue.  No definite vascular invasion is seen.  There is a cavity adjacent to the tumour, which is in keeping with previous surgery.  The overall appearances are similar to those described in the previous pathology report (WHYALLA HOSPITAL Hospital, DICKINSON 2 SOUTH, CY-11-113968).  The appearances are consistent with those of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma with giant cells.  The tumour is completely excised.  The tumour is 5.5mm to the deep margin (block B2) and is 4mm to the 3 o'clock soft tissue margin (block B4).  The other margins are well clear.

1062	3774	Sections show a moderately differentiated (grade 2) chondrosarcoma, apparently arising fromthe 9th rib.  The tumour consists of cartilage with a moderate increase in cellularity and the chondrocyte nuclei show moderate pleomorphism, atypia and hyperchromasia.  Binucleate chondrocytes are noted.  Much of the central tumour is necrotic and this is what gave the macroscopic impression of central cystic change.  The tumour invades into skeletal muscleand other soft tissues of the chest wall with a lobulated, pushing margin.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  Mitoses are infrequent.  In the sections the 9th rib is completely replaced by tumour and the 8th rib is also partly involved by tumour (block 10).  Some pleura is noted on the deep surface of the mass and this shows non-specificreactive mesothelial proliferation.  No pleural invasion by tumour is seen.	PHI:Null

1066	1744	A & B.  The peritoneal nodule (specimen A) is a malignant spindle cell tumour, composed of moderately pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in cellular fascicles, with numerous admixed atypical mitoses and patchy chronic inflammation. At the edge of the spindle tumour, there are numerous epithelioid to bizarre highly pleomorphic malignant cells. The intra-abdominal tumour (specimen B) is a high grade malignant epithelioid tumour. The tumour is composed of sheets of discohesive, highly pleomorphic epithelioid cells, including binucleate, multinucleateand bizarre pleomorphic tumour cells.

1066	2266	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1066	3008	The peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours are malignant spindle cell and epithelioid tumours, respectively. Both tumours have a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining, and the overall appearance is similar to the retroperitoneal high grade epithelioid and spindle cell sarcoma previously described in the pathology slide review from South Africa in 2057 (51G89448YRC Worldwide). These peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours most likely represent a spectrum of morphological atypia within a high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Although no lipoblasts are seen, it is possible that these tumours represent foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which could be confirmed with FISH testing for MDM2 amplification.

1066	3295	There is focal S100 staining in the intra-abdominal tumour, and although additional markers of melanoma such as HMB45 and Melan-A are negative and melanoma is considered less likely, the possibility that this tumour represents metastatic malignant melanoma cannot be entirely excluded.

24	4490	The existence of ER -ve, PR +ve cancer has been disputed in the literature. Some authors suggest positive PR staining in this context may be due to non-specific binding by PR antibody (De Maeyer et al,, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):335-6 and Hefti at al., Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R68).

The ellipse of overlying skin measures 80mm from 12 to 6 o'clock and 20mm from 3 to 9 o'clock.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked black, 9 o'clock margin blue, deep margin purple.  Specimen is serially sectioned from 12 to 6 o'clock into fourteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock, slice fourteen 6 o'clock.  On sectioning and in slices five to eight there is a well circumscribed possibly encapsulated solid mass measuring 40mm (superficial to deep) margin and 30mm from 3 to 9 o'clock, 25mm from 12 to 6 o'clock.  The cut surface of the tumour is solid and tanned with tiny areas of haemorrhage.

353	3440	A.  The 40mm tumouris a solitary fibrous tumour with a multinodular configuration.  The closely opposed  tumour nodules are circumscribed,  thinly encapsulated and composed of moderately cellular spindle cells arranged haphazardly, in storiform arrays andin short fascicles.  Numerous ectatic haemangiopericytomatous vessels are present and there are foci of stromal myxoid alteration and foci of fibrosis.  The mildly pleomorphic tumour cells are spindled with pointed ends, ill defined cytoplasmic borders, pale granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.  Mitoses are easily identified and number up to 8 per 10 hpf and there is focal central coagulative necrosis, which may however relate to previous core biopsy sampling. The tumour is mostly surrounded by unremarkable mature adipose tissue, however, focally the thin fibrous pseudocapsule forms the margin of the specimen at 9 o'clock (<0.1mm clear) (A14). The 3 o'clock margin is 1mm cleartowards the deep margin (A10) and the true deep margin is 6mm clear (A10) The 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins are well clear.

353	3659	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
353	4448	The morphological appearances and immunoprofile are consistent with a solitary fibrous tumour.  Haemangiopericytoma is a less specific term, used in older literature, that described tumours that would currently be classified as solitary fibrous tumours, as well as, several other soft tissue neoplasms with similar staghorn vasculature.   Although histological features do not reliably predict behaviour in solitary fibrous tumours, the presence in this case of increased mitotic activity (8 per 10 hpf), possible tumour related coagulative necrosis and areas of moderate cellularity are findings associated with more aggressive (malignant) behaviour. The tumour, however, lacks other features associated with malignancy such as infiltrative borders and significant nuclear pleomorphism.	PHI:Null

563	1225	A.  Sections show a variably cellular circumscribed spindle cell tumour containing focal areas of myxoid change.  A very small number of thick walled blood vessels are present within the tumour with the cells arranged in vague interdigitating fascicles.  The cells have indistinct eosinophilic cytoplasm with bland oval nuclei, fine chromatin andoccasional small nucleoli.  No areas of necrosis are seen.  Occasional mitosis are seen (approximately 5 per 10 high power field) and the Ki-67 index is focally up to 5%.	PHI:Null
563	1409	The tumour cells show moderate positive staining with neurofilament and there is possible weak patchy staining with S100.  The PanCK, desmin, SMA, EMA and Glut1 stains are negative.	PHI:Null

563	2622	The slides were reviewed by Dr PEARL Beskom, Dr U Stauss, Dr U Sandhaus and myself without a definite consensus diagnosis being reached. The positive neurofilament stain (NF6S), however, would support a cellular neurofibroma with atypia. The mitoses, up to 3mm/2. would support low grade malignancy for this tumour which is composed of poorly defined bundles of small spindle cells. The proliferation index - up to 10% nuclei positive with Ki67 could also fit a low grade malignancy.	DOCTOR:PEARL Beskom\nDOCTOR:U Stauss\nDOCTOR:U Sandhaus

583	4564	A.  Sections show the75mm tumour is a microinvasive thymoma which is difficult to morphologically sub-classify.   The mostly encapsulated tumour shows some organotypical features with angulated, mostly acellular, fibrous bands separating large lobules and sheets of tumour cells and there are some perivascular spaces.  Much of the tumour has a WHO type A morphology and comprises relatively bland spindle cells arranged in sheets, trabeculae with some micro-glandular/micro-cystic areas. Pericellular reticulin is demonstrated in these areas.  Round to polygonal epithelioid cells arranged in rosette-like structures are also present and compatible with type A morphology.  Alesser but significant component displays micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma features with interconnected  nests of bland epithelioid cells and scant admixed lymphocytes separated by lymphoid rich stroma containing scattered lymphoidfollicles but no admixed epithelial cells.  There are multiple foci of definite capsular invasion (eg. Block A5, block A19) into adjacent mediastinal adipose tissue/thymic adipose tissue and no neighbouring mediastinal structures are present.  The invasive foci are predominately smooth contoured nodules with a micronodular thymoma and lymphoid rich stroma appearance. However, in some areas, the type A areas transitions to a minor component, including extracapsular tumour, that shows a sheet-like arrangement of spindled to polygonal with at least mild atypia including irregular grooved nuclei, vesicular chromatin, conspicuous nucleoli and easily identified tumour cell mitoses (numbering up to 5 /10 HPF) (Block A10).  Focal lymphovascular invasion is present within the capsule of the tumour (Block A9).  No perineural invasion is seen.  The invasive tumour focally reaches the inked surgical resection margin (Block A 21, Block A6) and these areas show micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma morphology.  The capsule of the tumour also forms the margin of resection across a broad front.   No evidence of thymic carcinoma is seen.  No lymph nodes are identified in the loosely attached adipose tissue, however, a separate nodule of type A thymoma is present,  presumably microinvasive tumour,  is present here (Block A11). Two lymph nodes, present in theperithymic adipose tissue, show reactive sinus histiocytosis but no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
583	4585	Immunohistochemistry	PHI:Null
583	5830	Immunohistochemical stains confirm that the type A areas show relatively sparse mature CD3 and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with no immature T lymphocytes (CD1a, CD99 and TdT negative) and scattered CD20 positive B cells.  Scattered dendritic cells, including Langerhans cells (CD1a andS100 positive) are also present.  The micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas show restricted keratin (AE1/AE3) expression within the epithelial areas and  no keratin positive cells within the intervening lymphoid stroma. The lymphoid stroma predominantly comprises mixed mature T cells (CD3 and CD5 positive) and CD20 positive B cells.  There is also an admixed immature T cells (CD1a, TdT and CD99) component which show accentuated distribution around the peripheral aspects of the epithelial nests.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is low within the bland type A spindle cells areas and  significantly higher within areas showing nuclear atypia (Block A10).  The CD117 stains scattered cells within the epithelial component, possibly admixed mast cells, however, no sheet like pattern of positive staining is seen.  The CD5 stain appears to correspond to the CD3 stain, highlighting T cells, without obvious CD5 expression within the epithelial cells.	PHI:Null
583	5840	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
583	6939	The invasive thymoma is difficult to subclassify.  The tumour shows definite WHO type A areas and separate micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas. By definition these subtypes lack nuclear atypia.  However, the type A tumour appears to transition to foci showing at least mild nuclear atypia and tumour cell mitoses. These areas don't quite correspond to typical B3 morphology of the WHO classification, as there are no squamoid features or raisinoid nuclear morphology.  I am not sure if these foci represent the WHO spindle cell variant of B3 subtype.  According to the Suster Moran classification of thymomas, which divides thymomas into well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated grading categories, and in which the poorly differentiated subtype corresponds to thymic carcinoma, the presence of cellular atypia and mitoses in this tumour warrants classification as a moderately differentiated thymoma (atypical thymoma).   I will seek a second opinion from Prof. Z. Werblow at MOUNT PLEASANT HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementaryreport will be issued.	DOCTOR:Z. Werblow\nHOSPITAL:MOUNT PLEASANT HOSPITAL

583	8396	I agree with your diagnosis of a thymoma with numerous foci of microscopic capsular invasion.  Subclassifing thymomas is somewhat subjective and some cases don't fit neatly into different diagnostic categories.  I favour this tumour being a type A thvmoma (with areas of micronodular thvmoma with a lvmphoid stroma).  Although there are occasional mitoses in areas, the morphology is still similar to other areas and in my opinion, no convincing areas of type B3 thymoma are seen.  The significance of the focally increased mitotic activity and Ki-67 proliferative index is uncertain.	PHI:Null

59	2789	A.   Sections show a fatty tumour which appears circumscribed.  It consists of sheets and also some lobules of adipocytes, with some intervening bands of dense fibrous tissue.  The tumour has been extensively sampled.  There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes but no lipoblasts are identified and no atypical cells areidentified in the fibrous bands or elsewhere.  There are no histologic features to suggest malignancy.  The tumour appeared well circumscribed macroscopically but histologically itabuts excision margins.  Adequacy of excision is difficult to assess.  Focally at the edge of the tumour there may be some extension into adjacent skeletal muscle (blocks O5, O5); this is a feature described in intramuscular lipomas.	IDNUM:O5\nIDNUM:O5

637	2756	Sections of the tumour show similar appearances to that seen inthe previously excised left colon tumour (24O65140). It has a lobulated contour and is composed of pleomorphic malignant spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells. In most areas, these malignant cells appear to be haphazardly arrangedwhile whorled structures are seen in other areas. Scattered foci of osteosarcomatous component are present (Block 17). The surrounding fatty tissue show adipocytic cells with mild size variation in which atypical hyperchromatic cells are seen in the stroma of their fibrocollagenous septae. The aggregate of features is consistent with that of a malignant sarcoma with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising from a well differentiated sclerosing type liposarcoma being favoured.

650	7056	Microscopic:	PHI:Null
650	7103	B and D (Left periventricular frontal tumour).	PHI:Null
650	7588	Multiple fragments of tumour consisting of moderately pleomorphic elongated cells, predominantly arranged in interweaving bundles.  Scattered cells with nuclear pseudoinclusions are identified.  Mitoses are easily found and the Ki-67 labelling index is approximately 20-30%.  Foci of necrosis are present and there is prominent microvascular proliferation.  Compared to the right frontal tumour (see below) this lesion is more cellular and the cells more uniform and less pleomorphic.	PHI:Null
650	7772	Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only and highlight the microvascular proliferation.  The tumour cells are strongly Vimentin positive and many are also GFAP positive.	PHI:Null
650	8179	There is moderate granular membranous and some cytoplasmic MIC2 staining. CD34 stains endothelial cells.  There is a small amount of focal patchy interstitial staining, although this is much less prominent than in the contralateral lesion (see:below).  Scattered strongly p53 : positive cells are noted, probably <5%. Compared to the contralateral lesion there are also more numerous weakly staining cells.	PHI:Null
650	8448	The majority ofthe tumour cells are negative for EMA although very rare cells, especially at periphery of several tissue fragments contain an EMA-positive paranuclear dot.  Stains for NeuN, chromogranin, synaptophysin, pancytokeratin, IDH1 RI25H and TTFI are negative.	PHI:Null
650	8496	A and C (Right frontal corpus callosum tumour):	PHI:Null
650	9090	The intraoperativesmear contains two populations of cells.  The predominant component consists of cells with large round or lobated nuclei of slightly different sizes with a thin, well defined nuclear membrane, uniformly granular chromatin containing several chromcentres and often a prominent nucleolus.  Scattered binucleate cells are noted and a number of these nuclei also containing pseudoinclusions.  There is a minor component of relatively uniform cells with elongated round ended nuclei but no nucleoli.  Some -perivascular lymphocytes are noted but no vascular proliferation is seen.	PHI:Null
650	9227	The permanent sections consist of multiple pieces of tissue including fragments of normal cerebral cortex and fragments of solid tumour.	PHI:Null
650	9987	The tumour is moderately cellular and pleomorphic.  Many of the tumour cells have medium to large round or lobated nuclei with a prominent nucleolus and a small amount of well delineated perinuclear clear to granular cytoplasm.  A number also contain nuclear pseudoinclusions and several are bi- or trinucleate.  Scattered triangular cells with darkly staining amphophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei are also included as are cells with large, hyperchromatic somewhat "smudgy" chromatin, cells with ovoid nuclei and perinuclear halos, and some with finely vacuolated cytoplasm.  Although a number of these cells resemble dysplastic neurons, stains for neural antigens including neurofilament protein, NeuN, synaptophysin and chromogranin are negative.	PHI:Null
650	10269	In some areas the interstitium is finely vacuolated and slightly basophilic, suggesting mucin.  There are scattered micro-cysts and very rare calcospherites.  No Rosenthal fibres or eosinophilic granular bodies are identified with haematoxylin and eosin. No ependyma is identified.	PHI:Null
650	10539	Perivascular chronic inflammatory cells are noted, often surrounding veins with some adventitial fibrosis.  There is no vascular proliferation or necrosis and mitotic figures are not identified.  The Ki67 labelling index is low (visually estimated at approximately 2%).	PHI:Null
650	10856	Although in one fragment the tumour appears to be well demarcated from the surrounding dense paucicellular fibrillary gliosis, neurofilament antibodies highlight prominent axons bundles traversing the tumour.  These are accentuated adjacent to vessels.  In some areas beaded axons and axonalspheroids are also noted.	PHI:Null
650	11232	Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only.  The GFAP staining is generally pale and most of the tumour cells do not show cytoplasmic immunoreactivity adjacent to the nucleus, although scattered GFAP positive processes are noted, especially adjacent to vessels.  These processes do not radiate towards the vessels as seen in ependymal perivascular pseudorosettes.	PHI:Null
650	11853	In addition to normal endothelial staining there is very strong, uniform CD34 immunoreactivity between the tumour cells resulting in haloes of CD34 negative cytoplasm surrounding-tumour nuclei.  Included fragments of cerebral cortex show the expected normal endothelial staining.  Vimentin also shows prominent dark interstitial staining in many of the tumourfragments, although less intense than the CD34 staining, as well as some cytoplasmic staining.  Prominent activated microglia and scattered macrophages are noted within the tumour with CD68 antibodies. Approximately 4-5% of tumour nucleiare weakly p53 positive.	PHI:Null
650	12097	NeuN identifies normal neurons in cortical fragments but not tumour cells. lmmunostains for synaptophysin, IDH R125H, chromogranin, pancytokeratin and TTFI are negative.  MIC2 (CD99) is also negative although there is high background staining.	PHI:Null
650	12318	FISH analysis (Dr R Maltez, CLONCURRY MULTI-PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE's Hospital) on the right frontal tumour was negative for lp/19q loss although polysomy for Ip and 19q was demonstrated.  There was no EGFR amplification.	DOCTOR:R Maltez\nHOSPITAL:CLONCURRY MULTI-PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE

650	12611	Comment:	PHI:Null
650	12957	The right frontal lesion is a low grade glioma without high grade features and is best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).  However, a number of unusual morphological findings are noted, including the very limited GFAP staining and the strong CD34 immunoreactivity, that are not typical of most WHO grade II diffuse astrocytomas.	PHI:Null
650	13337	Although limited or absent GFAP staining is described in some subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, there are no other features supporting this diagnosis.  Similarly, although CD34 immunoreactivity is a feature of many glioneuronal tumours and of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, the other morphologicaland immunohistochemical findings in this case do not support these diagnoses.	PHI:Null
650	13784	The relationship between the left and the right frontal lesions is uncertain.  Although they are radiologically and morphologically distinct, suggesting separate lesions, the possibility of microscopic continuity or a common origin cannot be entirely excluded. FISH analysis to assess Ip and 19q polysomy and EGFR amplification will be performed on the left frontal glioblastoma.  If clinically indicated, further genetic analysis may be helpful.	PHI:Null
650	14114	This case was reviewed by Dr Arie Perry (Director of Neuropathology, UCSF) who agreed that the left frontal lesion is a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).  He also agreed that the right frontal tumour is unusual but considered that the features were those of a low grade tumour, best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).	PHI:Null
650	14272	commented that he had also seen low grade astrocytomas with limited GFAP immunoreactivity.  He suggested that further immunostaining for other glial markers,	PHI:Null
650	14324	including Olig-2, Sox-2 and S100, might-be helpful.	PHI:Null

663	3022	A.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  The specimen comprises fibroadipose tissue, subcutis, skeletal muscle and some fascia.  Adjacent to this short sutured margin (towards tumour) there is organising granulation tissue, fibrosis, chronic inflammation and fat necrosis consistent with previous surgery.  Within this area there are vascular changes consistent with previous radiotherapy including mural hyalinisation and intimal myxoid alteration.  Scattered within the area adjacent to the short sutured margin and within septa between skeletal muscle bundles, there are dispersed spindle and stellate cells with a generally low nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, mild nuclear atypia and some fine cytoplasmic vacuolation.  Some cells have a ganglion cell-like appearance.  These cells are favoured to represent fibroblast/myofibroblasts with mild atypia secondary to radiotherapy.  Occasional similar cells are seen withinfat lobules, however, no definite lipoblasts, significant variation in adipocyte cell size or markedly atypical stromal cells are seen.

668	1950	Sections show a circumscribed tumour within submucosa and partly ulcerating the overlying mucosa.  The tumour is of low to moderate cellularity and consists of spindle shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, in haphazard fascicles.  The cells have themorphologic appearance of smooth muscle cells and this is confirmed with strong positive staining for desmin.  Stains for C-Kit (CD117) and CD34 are negative.  No mitoses are identified and the proliferation index with a K-67 stain is very low, <1%.  The appearances are of a leiomyoma.  There isno significant atypia and there is no evidence of malignancy.  Excision is complete.  The overlying mucosa shows features of a severe chronic gastritis.  No Helicobacter is identified.  The gastritis may be non-specific, related to the mass lesion, but there is associated prominentatrophy of specialised gastric glands and the possibility of an autoimmune gastritis should be considered.  There is no intestinal metaplasiaor dysplasia.	PHI:Null

689	4555	Sections of the described cavity anterior to and abutting the sternum in the superior part of the specimen show a deposit of high grade pleomorphic sarcoma.  Thisinvolves the bone of the manubrium (block 28) and adjacent soft tissue.  It has a pushing margin and much of it is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue.  Decalcification has affected tumour preservation but it is cellular and composed of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Numerous multinucleate tumour giant cells are present.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Tumour abuts the first rib but the rib is not involved.  The second rib is also not involved by tumour.  Tumour within manubrium is 3mm from the deep excision margin but there is intact bone between tumour and the margin.  Other margins are well clear.	PHI:Null
689	5025	Sections of the described tan mass expanding the manubrium show dense fibrous tissue expanding and partly replacing the bone; no tumour is seen in this region.  Sections from the inferior part of the specimen show an old seroma cavity with surrounding dense fibrous tissue.  There is some old fat necrosis in the surrounding tissue, with associated mild patchy chronic inflammation.  Adjacent muscle is atrophic.  No tumour is seen in the inferior part of the specimen.

785	424	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI:Null
785	2380	Specimen labelled "Whipple's with portal vein" consists of a Whipple's resection with a bowel measuring 270mmin length including area of distal stomach 25mm in length.  The pancreatic head measures 65 x 55 x 50mm.  Upon opening, the proximal duodenum appears dilated with the mucosa flattened.  There is a roughened area near the ampulla projecting into the lumen which is possibly ulcerated, measuring 15 x 10mm.  The duodenal mucosa appears haemorrhagic distally but otherwise unremarkable.  The anterior pancreatic margin is inked blue.  The uncinate is inked black.  The posterior is inkedgreen with the portal vein area inked red.  The superior aspect is also inked black.  The pancreatic neck resection margin is shaved and the underlying area is inked yellow.  The cut surface reveals a friable tumour which appears to be centred in the duodenum in close proximity to the papilla.  The tumour extends into the lumen and appears to partially obstruct it.  The surrounding pancreatic tissue appears fibrotic and it is difficult to assess the extent of involvementof the tumour into the pancreas.  The cystic duct appears dilated throughout its length and was unable to be probed into the duodenum, and appears therefore obstructed.  Multiple lymph nodes were identified in the pericystic duct and along the gastric resection margin.  The attached gallbladder measures 100mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 45mm.Maximum thickness of the wall is 7mm.  The wall appears oedematous in places.  The mucosa has prominent yellow streaks around.  The lumen is full of large amounts of green biliary sludge but no gallstones are identified.  The cut surface reveals that the tumour appears clear of the portal vein.  Two separate fragments of fatty tissue ?omentum were identified measuring 130 and 150mm in maximum dimension.  A few small cream nodules are identified in the omental fat ?fat necrosis.  No other suspicious areas are identified.	PHI:Null

794	2566	Sections from the cardia, body, antrum, greater curve and lesser curve show extensive involvement of the stomach wall by a poorly differential adenocarcinoma of diffuse type.  The tumour consists of small groups, cords and single cells which are present extensively throughout the mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer and subserosa.  The cells have large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Numerous signet ring cells are noted.  Tumour extends to the serosal surface of the stomach and also extensively infiltrates fat attached to the lesser curve and omental fat attached to the greater curve.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is noted in the submucosa of the body.  Foci of perineural invasion are also identified in the stomach wall.	PHI:Null

796	2070	A.  Sections show tumour tissue.  No normal brain is seen.  The tumour is cellular and consists mainly of spindle cells with elongated nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, in haphazard short fascicles.  There are also foci where the tumour cells have more plump atypical nuclei and better fined cytoplasm.  Mitoses are present, including atypical forms.  The features are consistent with a gliosarcoma with predominant sarcomatous component.	PHI:Null
796	2799	B.Sections show pieces of tumour tissue.  The larger piece has overlying dura.  No normal brain tissue is seen.  The tumour is similar to specimen A.  It consists mainly of spindle cells in short, haphazard fascicles.  Mitoses are frequent,numbering up to 22 per 10 HPF, and some atypical mitoses are noted.  Some tumour cells have a single, prominent nucleolus.  The cells are predominantly spindle shaped but there are patchy areas of more plump, pleomorphic, atypical cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and better defined cell borders.  Some binucleate and multinucleate tumour cells are also noted.  There are patchy foci of tumour necrosis.  Tumour abuts and focally invades into and through the overlying dura (block B4).	PHI:Null
796	3425	Reticulin stains show that most of the tumour is reticulin rich but a minor component has more scant reticulin.  The features are most consistent with a gliosarcoma.  The sarcomatous component is the predominant spindle cell tumour which is reticulin rich, while the high grade glioma (astrocytic) component has the more plump, pleomorphic cells and scant reticulin.  The high grade glioma component also shows more prominent and extensive GFAP positivity.  There is a merging of the glial and sarcomatous components.  A p53 immunostain is negative.  A Ki-67 stain shows a high proliferation index, estimated at around 80%.	PHI:Null

806	1059	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Nannen)	DOCTOR:S Nanne
806	1937	The gastric tumour is a 32mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is predominantly circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin and expands the muscularis propria. The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in broad interweaving fascicles. In areas, the tumour cells appear moderately pleomorphic with variably sized nucleoli. There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation. Centrally, the tumour shows prominent stromal oedema and hyalinosis. Mitoses are present up to 3 per 50 high power fields. Necrosis is inconspicuous. The tumour is largely surrounded by muscularis propria, but focally extends close to, but does not appear to involve, theserosal surface. The tumour is clear of the gastric resection margins (0.56mm). The overlying gastric mucosa shows no significant histologic abnormality.	PHI:Null

806	2565	The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours less than 50mm in size and with a low mitotic rate (less than 5/50hpf), are typically associated with a low risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM).

810	3099	A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that the described polyp is benign.  The endometrium elsewhere is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  Focally on the serosa of the anteriorand posterior uterus there are psammoma bodies with associated fibrous tissue and very occasional degenerate tumour cells.  The features are consistent with focal serosal involvement by treated tumour.  Sections of the left fallopian tube show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma quite extensively involving the tube wall and serosa, and also extending to involve part of the mucosa.  No carcinoma in situ is identified in the residual tubal lining epithelium or at the fimbrial end.	PHI:Null
810	3221	Sections of the right fallopian tube show scattered foci of serous carcinoma in the tube wall and at the fimbrial end.	PHI:Null
810	3359	Sections of both ovaries show very occasional small serosal and sub-serosal tumour deposits but the ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.	PHI:Null
810	3709	B.  Sections show omentum with one large deposit and multiple other deposits of serous carcinoma.  This is moderately differentiated.  There is some evidence of chemotherapy effect with some replacement of tumour by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.  This is assessed as less than 50% tumour replacement by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.	PHI:Null
810	3971	Comment:  The involvement of the wall of the left fallopian tube is quite extensive and there is some mucosal involvement but the pattern of tumour suggests spread inwards from the serosa, rather than tubal origin.  The tumour is most likely primary peritoneal.	PHI:Null

814	3939	A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour is moderately differentiated, comprising slit-like glands and some papillae lined by epithelial cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm.  However there is a significant proportion which consists of solid sheets and trabeculae of tumour cells so overall it is poorly differentiated.  The tumour involves the body and fundus of the uterus anteriorly and posteriorly.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrialinvasion measures 9.5mm where total myometrial thickness is 14mm.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium, some of which is well away from the main invasive tumour.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Two small leiomyomas, and adenomyosis, are noted in the myometrium.  Sections of the ovaries showseveral small simple cysts bilaterally.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.

819	3182	A. The sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  The tumour surrounds the large bile ducts near the hilum.  Although most of the bile ductepithelium has been sloughed, atypical cells arising from the epithelium and forming papillary structures protruding into the duct can be seen (slide A5).  The tumour invades into adjacent liver and soft tissues and involves the caudate, left and right lobes.  Several small tumour nodules, many involving the portal tracts, are found distant from the main lesion (e.g., slide A 15 in the left lobe).  Malignant cells focally reach the capsular surface of the liver.  There is patchy chronic inflammation but no cirrhosis in the liver.  Several irregularly dilated bile ducts are seen and atypical epithelial cells are present in occasional dilated bile ducts.	PHI:Null
819	4280	tumour has a heterogenous appearance.  In many areas, there are glandular structures with abundant fibrotic stroma.  Variable amounts of mucin formation are seen, highlighted by the PAS stain.  Inother areas, there are micropapillary structures or cribriform glands with central necrosis.  There is a variable degree of pleomorphism in the tumour cells.  The cytoplasm varies from clear to pale eosinophilic and is moderately abundant. The tumour cells strongly express keratin 19 antigen by the immunoperoxidase technique.  Keratin 7 antigen is also expressed but in a patchy distribution.  There is no convincing expression of Hep-Par 1 antigen. Membranous expression ofbeta catenin is present but not nuclear expression of this antigen.  The tumour extends to the soft tissue resection margin over a 5mm front (block A5) and focally it is 0.3mm from the liver resection margin (block A6).  Tumour is foundwithin thin walled lymphovascular channels in the portal tracts but no tumour is found within major branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein.  Prominent perineural invasion ispresent.	PHI:Null

821	4469	The sample wasanalysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]).Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation.

821	4513	INTERPRETATION	PHI:Null
821	4664	No BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors.	PHI:Null
821	4673	Comments	PHI:Null
821	5301	BRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases(90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]. V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients. Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]. The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].	PHI:Null

831	3585	Comment:	PHI:Null
831	4217	A binary scheme has been proposed for grading appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei, with all tumours with significant spread beyond right lower quadrant (bona fide pseudomyxoma) termed mucinous carcinoma peritonei (low grade versus high grade). This low/high grade stratification is similar to Ronnett scheme and WHO.  Tumours with intermediate or hybrid features (PMCA-Intermediate -Ronnett) are grouped with low grade tumours in the Bradley scheme in view of similar behaviour in their series, and in a later series (Chua 2012), but less favourable behaviour was described in the earlier Ronnett series for this intermediate group.	PHI:Null
831	4749	This type of tumour would generally but not exclusively be of appendix origin. From the sections available from the previous appendicectomy from 19/12/2060, although there is a small mucosal probable adenomatous lesion present in one of the sections (see separate review), it would be difficult to definitely conclude that this was the primary lesion histologically. The peritoneal mucinous neoplasm epithelium is more eosinophilic and not very similarto the small atypical focus in the appendix. Clinical correlation recommended.

840	5413	"The H&E sections supplied are Blocks 17 to 24 from the single largest lymph node which is virtually replaced by a malignant spindle cell tumour. These sections also include 3 separate smaller lymph nodes which show reactive changes and appear uninvolved by malignancy. The tumour is composed of short and intersecting fascicles of spindled cells with occasional small groupings of more epithelioid cells. The tumour cells show considerable nuclear pleomorphism with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, vesicular chromatin and plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm. Occasional tumour giant cells areseen. There are scattered foci of tumour necrosis and there is brisk mitotic activity with occasional atypical mitoses. These cells show both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for S100 protein as well as staining for vimentin, fascin andWT1 (WT1 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SOUTH stain). These cells appear negative for melan-A and HMB45 both on the Devon Energy stains and PATHOLOGYWEST stains. They are also negative on our staining for tyrosinase and MITF1.  Schmorl's stain for melanin is negative. They are also negative for multiple cytokeratins including pan cytokeratin, cytokeratin 19 and the cytokeratins listed in Dr Jamison's report. They are also negative for EMA. The tumour cells appear negative for leukocyte common antigen, CD20, CD3, CD30, PAX-5 and EBV-LMP. They appear negative for histiocytic and dendritic cell markers CD163, CD68, CD1a, langerin, CD21, CD23, CD35, and CD4, which highlight background histiocytic and dendritic cells only. They are negative for smooth muscle markers Desmin and smooth muscle actin.	DEPARTMENT:INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SOUTH\nORGANIZATION:Devon Energy\nDEPARTMENT:PATHOLOGYWEST\nDOCTOR:Jamiso
840	5551	In the background there is some residual lymphoid cells including occasional reactive follicles, compressed to the periphery of the node.	PHI:Null
840	6305	Overall, I think the most likely diagnosis is metastatic melanoma. I have not had much experience with interdigitating reticulum cell sarcoma as these are rare tumours, but from the literature they are describedas usually having more bland nuclei without necrosis and a lower mitotic rate and they often show variable staining for CD68, lysozyme and CD45. Review of the atypical melanocytic lesion removed from the left arm in 2061 is recommended.If you have access to SOX10 immunoperoxidase, this might prove helpful.  Unfortunately we have only just received a sample of the antibody and have not been able to get it working as yet. Electromicroscopy might also be considered if there is still doubt over the diagnosis after review of the skin lesion.	DATE:2061=>2061

849	2308	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr D Balcomb)	DOCTOR:D Balcomb
849	3092	A.  Sections show a spindle cell tumour of low to moderate cellularity, with some skeletal muscle and a small amount of fat at one edge.  The tumour cells have elongated and plump oval nuclei.  Some of the plump cells are binucleate or multinucleate and have a moderate amount of amphophilic cytoplasm, and these cells often have a single prominent nucleolus.  The cells are haphazardly dispersed in short fascicles within a fibrous stroma.  Mitoses are infrequent and no necrosis is seen.  The tumour abuts the described smooth surface and also extends virtually to the described roughened area at one pole of the specimen (block A5).  In view of the appearances seen in the other specimens (specimens B and C) the features are mostconsistent with a de-differentiated liposarcoma.	PHI:Null
849	3265	B.Sections of the described nodule show that this consists of old, necrotic fat, with surrounding fibrous tissue. There are foci of calcification within the necrotic fat.	PHI:Null
849	3639	Sections of the bowel segment show large intestinal wall.  There is recentischaemic damage to the mucosa.  The wall is unremarkable but, in sections from the described dilated segment, there is atypical spindle cell tumour, of low cellularity, involving subserosal tissue.  No definite tumour is seen in the sections of bowel from the proximal and distal excisionmargins.	PHI:Null
849	4184	Sections from the pericolic fat show mature appearing fat with scattered atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, both within the fat and in septae between fat lobules (blocks B10, B11).  The features are most in keeping with a well differentiated, lipoma-like liposarcoma.  The identification of this component would mean, therefore, that the high grade sarcoma identified in the specimens A and C, and the osteosarcoma identified in the previous resection from 2059, are most consistent with components of a de-differentiated liposarcoma.	DATE:previous=>2064-05-27\nDATE:2059=>2059
849	4318	The tumourseen in the subserosal tissue of the colon is most consistent with sclerosing variant of well differentiated liposarcoma.	PHI:Null
849	5096	C.  Sections show tumour with a variable appearance.  The majority has features of a high grade sarcoma.  This mainly consists of highly atypical, pleomorphic cells, sometimes with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm, within a loose and myxoid stroma.  With immunostains the atypical cells are strongly vimentin and desmin positive and also show some patchy smooth muscle actin and myogenin positivity.  Stains for CD34 and S100 are negative.  The proliferation index with a Ki-67 stain in the most atypical area is around 50%.  The appearances are of a de-differentiated liposarcoma showing rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation.  Much of the tumour has a lobulated outline but de-differentiated liposarcoma is seen extending to at least one inked excision margin (block C15).	PHI:Null
849	5490	A minor component of well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma is also identified (blocks C11, C14).  This also appears to extend to at least one excision margin (block C14).  Some tumour comprising hyalinised tissue of low cellularity, with scattered large atypical cells, consistent with sclerosing variant of well differentiated liposarcoma, is also noted (eg. Block C1, C9, C10).	PHI:Null
849	5814	Sectionsof the attached kidney show end stage stages with marked atrophy, hyalinisation of most glomeruli, severe tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis.

A short segmentof proximal ureter is present 60 x 5mm.  Sectioning shows a large circumscribed tumour measuring 105 x 85 x 65mm.  The tumour is present in the mid and lower pole and shows a heterogenous yellow greyish/brownish cut surface.  The tumourappears to abut the renal capsule and pelvis. The hilar soft tissue margin is >10mm clear of the tumour macroscopically. The renal vein and ureteric mucosa appear unremarkable.  No lymph nodes are identified.  The adrenal gland is identified in the superior pole 45 x 5 x 4mm showing no unusual features.  The non-neoplastic kidney shows wedge shape solid pale areas (?infarctions).  The perinephric fat at the inferior aspect shows massive haemorrhage.	PHI:Null

855	2357	Sections show a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 2.  The tumour is located in the mid and lower pole of the right kidney and measures 105 x 85 x 65mm.  The tumour abuts the renal capsule and renal pelvis but does not infiltrate these structures.  The renal sinus is infiltrated by tumour and the vessels of the renal hilum and kidney contain embolic material.  The preoperative embolisation appears to have little effect on the viability of the tumour but the adjacent uninvolved kidney shows areas of acute cortical infarction.	PHI:Null

861	3530	Sections show a solitary hepatocellular tumour (35mm), which is difficult to classify.  The overall appearances are favouring those of well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.

863	2891	A.  Sections of small bowel show a tumour which ulcerates overlying epithelium.  The cells are uniform in nature with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei with granular chromatin and small indistinct nucleoli.  The tumourcells show positive staining with CD56 and are negative for CK20 and TTF1.  The features are that of a neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid).  The mitotic count is approximately 6 per 10HPF and the Ki67 is approximately 15%.  The tumour is thus classified as a neuroendocrine tumour G2 (NET G2, WHO 2010 classification).  The tumour extensively infiltrates muscularis propria and extends into subserosal and mesenteric adipose tissue.  No definite peritoneal surface involvement is seen.  Lymphovascular invasion is present.  The tumour lies approximately 20mm from the closest resection margin.  Due to the small amount of attached mesentery, no lymph nodes are identified, however there is extensive infiltration of mesenteric adipose tissue by tumour.  The remaining bowel mucosa shows no significant abnormality.	PHI:Null

871	1809	The gastric tumour is a 95mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST expands the subserosal tissue and appears circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin. The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in short fascicles with areas of intervening stromal hyalinosis, oedema and very focal necrosis. There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation. Mitoses are present up to 5 per 50 high power fields. The tumour is 5.5mm from the gastric resection margin and extends close, but does not involve, the overlying serosal surface. The overlying gastric mucosa shows a mild to moderate non-specific chronic gastritis.	PHI:Null

876	3279	C.  Sections show a 14mm grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. The carcinoma is present laterally within the specimen and is composed of mild to moderately pleomorphic cells arranged in cords, solid clusters and small tubules. Scattered intracytoplasmic lumen formation is seen.  Although in areas the tumour displays lobular carcinoma-like morphology, including targetoid growth around benign ductules, the E cadherin immunostain is diffusely positive, more consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.  Invasive carcinoma focally extends to the lateral excision margin superiorly. There are at least five (5) foci of lymphovascular invasion (endothelial lining confirmed with positive expression for D240 and CD31). Unusually, although these foci show similar cytonuclear features to the adjacent stromal invasive tumour they display more distinct tubule formation. Focal minimal calcification is present associated with the invasive tumour.  There is also low to intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in-situ confined within the borders of the invasive tumour.

893	1480	Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy measuring 120mm in length with a section of terminal ileum 40mm.  Starting at the terminal ileum and extending into the caecum 38mm from the proximal resection margin and 62mm from the distal resection margin is apolypoid ulcerated tumour occupying the majority of the caecum with a maximum length of 35mm and width of 30mm.  There is puckering of the peritoneal surface of the caecum at the base of the appendix.  The appendix has a length of 52mm and appears dilated with a maximum external diameter of 17mm.  In the caecum, the tumour appears to invade and abut the serosal surface.  The tumour appears to obstruct the appendiceal orifice but does not invade into the appendix.  One pedunculated polyp is identified, 55mm from the distal resection margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.	PHI:Null

In one area the serosa is inflamed and haemorrhagic and it is debateable whether tumour cells have breached the serosa.

904	1871	B.  Specimen labelled "Left breast marking stitch at superior" consists of a mastectomy 160mm (medial to lateral) x 155mm (inferior to superior) x 28mm (superficial to deep).There is an overlying ellipse of skin 145 x 45mm which includes a nipple areola complex 30 x 30mm which appears unremarkable.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin inked black.  The cut surface reveal a firm cream/yellow stellate poorly circumscribed lesion 1-2 o'clock position 45mm from the nipple (lesion one).  Lesion one measures 20mm (medial to lateral) x 13mm (inferior to superior) x 9mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margins is as follows:  deep margin 3mm, superior superficial 17mm, and well clear of medial, lateral and inferior margins.  There is an ill defined firm area at 5 o'clock position 50mm from the nipple which measures 8mm (medial to lateral) x 6mm (inferior to superior) x 6mm (superficial to deep).  Superficial margin is 4mm away, the deep margin is 10mm away and is well clear of the medial and lateral margin.	PHI:Null

904	2853	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Berta):	DOCTOR:P Berta
904	3293	A-C.  Sections show three separate invasive carcinomas.  The main carcinoma at 1-2 o'clock 45mm FN is a grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 1).  A separate grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 2) is present around the large  subareolar ducts of the nipple and is approximately 30mm from the main carcinoma.  An incidental 2.3mm grade 1 infiltrating tubular carcinoma (tumour 3) is present about 2mm deep to tumour 2.	PHI:Null
904	4688	Paraffin sections of the single sentinel lymph node show a minute cluster of tumour cells with occasional intracytoplasmic lumina within the subcapsular sinus measuring <0.1mm in maximum dimension (detected on an H&E stained section, block A1L2). This particular area has cut out on deeper levels examined with H&E and keratin immunostains, however, in adjacent tissue in the same cross section keratin immunostained sections reveal further dispersed single tumour cells within the subcapsular sinus distributed over an area of 4mm.  The total number of tumour cellsin this cross section, both H&E and keratin immunostain detected number less than 200 cells and is consistent with node involvement by isolated tumour cells of lobular carcinoma.  However in a separate cross section of the sentinel lymph node, keratin immunostains reveal a further minute cluster of cohesive and single tumour cells 0.3mm in dimension as well as dispersed single cells in the subcapsular and medullary sinuses, distributed over an area of 5mm.  While an interpretation of this second separate focus of intranodal tumour cells as isolated tumour cells is possible (the 0.3mm cluster is not strictly a completely cohesive and expansile cluster and the total number of tumour cells in this crosssection number less than 200 cells), I have classified it as a micrometastasis (recognizing overlap in the definition).

904	10549	Within the epidermis of the nipple, overlying tumour 2, there are scattered medium to large  intraepithelial cells with round to oval regular nuclei and minimal cytoplasm (Blosk B21). No cell clusters or intracytoplasmic lumina are seen The dPAS stain for mucin is negative.  The cells show positive expression with CK7 and ER immunostains.  The cells are negative for Melan A, CD138 and HER2 (1+).  The appearances favour benign Toker cells over Paget's disease. The cells are 9mm clear of the closest cutaneous margin.	PHI:Null

909	2077	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Q Guill):	DOCTOR:Q Guill
909	2737	A.  Sectionsshow a high grade carcinoma arranged in sheets, trabeculae and papillae containing fibrovascular cores, with extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with pleomorphic nuclei containing coarse chromatin and small nucleoli.  Focally the tumour has a squamoid appearance and no glandular formation is seen.  Abundant mitoses are present.  The tumour lies adjacent and focally adherent to the ovary, which otherwise appears normal.  A section of normal fallopian tube is also identified.  The tumour shows strong positive staining with CK7, CA125 and WT1.  The CK20 and CK5/6 stains are negative.	PHI:Null
909	2746	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
909	3082	Although the tumour cells have very similar morphology that seen in the previously diagnosed high grade urothelial carcinoma (L7 CONSULTING ROOMS: Q11478963), the immunohistochemical profile is different.  The urothelial carcinoma shows positive staining with CK7 and CK20, plus focal staining with CK5/6.  The CA125 stain is negative.	DEPARTMENT:L7 CONSULTING ROOMS\nIDNUM:Q11478963
909	3355	It is thus concluded that the current tumour may not represent a recurrence of urothelial carcinoma, but instead is favoured to represent a poorly differentiated mulleriancarcinoma.  As a normal ovary and fallopian tube are present, the tumour may be of peritoneal origin.	PHI:Null
909	3618	B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive and contains a small benign endometrial polyp.  The myometrium, fallopian tubes and left ovary show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
909	3718	C.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null

912	2467	Sections show small intestinal wall with a neuroendocrine tumour.  This consists of nests, trabeculae and cords of cells with medium sized and large, relatively uniform round nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The nuclei have fine granular chromatin and sometimes a small nucleolus.  Some tumour cells have pink cytoplasmic granules.  The tumour forms occasional small glands.  The mucosal surface of the tumour is ulcerated.  It arises from the mucosa and invades through the muscularis propria with an infiltrative appearance, and into subserosal tissue.  It appears to breach the serosal surface very focally.  The assessment of lymphovascular invasion is difficult because of retraction artefact around the tumour cell nests but there is considered to be some lymphovascular invasion in the bowel wall and also multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the attached mesentery.  No perineural invasion is identified.  Mitoses are infrequent, less than 1 per 10 high power fields, and there is no tumour necrosis.  The proliferation index with a Ki-67 stain is low, estimated at 2%.  With other immunostains the tumour cells stain strongly chromogranin positive and also show some patchy, weaksynaptophysin positivity.	PHI:Null
912	2734	The sections of small bowel elsewhere are unremarkable and the proximal and distal margins are well clear.  The described separate serosal nodule is a focus of scarring and foreign body reaction, possiblyrelated to previous surgery; no tumour is seen in this nodule.	PHI:Null

913	2121	Sections through the mesenteric nodule show a 35mm deposit of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid tumour). The appearance is identical to that of the previously reported small bowel carcinoid tumour (62Y96033). The deposit expands the mesentery and is partially surrounded by a cuff of variably dense fibrous tissue and mesenteric fat. Focally, the tissue overlying the tumour deposit is replaced by inflamed granulation tissue. There are scattered foci of lymphovascular space invasion. One of five sampled lymph nodes show metastatic tumour (1/5). The tumour does not involve the overlying bowel wall. The bowel adjacent to the presumed anastomotic site show mild non-specific mucosal chronic inflammatory change with expansion of the lamina propria and thickened intestinal villi. The bowel wall is viable and there are scattered serosal adhesions, including a focal mild foreign body response to polarisable (?suture) material. The surgical margins appear clear of tumour.

925	2382	Sections show three separate subcapsular deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma ranging from 10mm to 90mm in maximum dimension.  The deposits are predominantly composed of a cribriform or fenestrated arrangement of large malignant glands lined by cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei.  There is  prominent central necrosis within the complex large glands.  A lesser component of smaller malignant tubular glands is also present.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen (some peritumoural retraction artefact and tumour carry over).	PHI:Null
925	2573	The closest deposit is 17mm clear of the surgical resection margin and abuts but does not appear to penetrate the liver capsule at the bare (non-peritonealised) area of the liver (block 14).	PHI:Null
925	3007	Away from the deposits the liver displays a normal lobular architecture.  The portal tracts contain a normal complement of bile ducts, hepatic arteries and hepatic veins and there is no significant portal fibrosis or inflammation.  Apart from minimal patchy macrovascular steatosis the hepatocytes are unremarkable.  An occasional portal Von-Meyenberg complex (bile duct hamartoma) is noted.  The gallbladder is essentially normal.

925	3029	Immunohistochemistry:	PHI:Null

925	3209	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
925	3900	In the context of a rectal lesion the morphological appearances and diffuse CDX2 immunoexpression are compatible with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.  However, the presence of minimal patchy positive tumoural CK20 immunostaining and diffusely positive TTF1 immuonstaining is unusual for colorectal carcinoma.  Thelatter finding is more typically seen in lung adenocarcinoma or thyroid carcinomas but positive expression has been reported in a subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas with the TTF1 antibody used in this case (Novocastra SPT24 clone).  Further clinical and radiological correlation is advised. Comparison with the morphological appearances of the rectal biopsy may be helpful.	PHI:Null

936	3418	A.  The 75mm polypoid tumour is a leiomyoma.  The circumscribed unencapsulated tumour straddles the cardio-oesophageal junction.  The tumour expands the wall of the distal oesophagus and extends into the upper stomach along its anterior wall reaching the proximal body.  Within the distal oesophagus the tumour appears to be focally continuous with attenuated muscularis mucosa and pushesinto outer muscularis propria. Within the mucosa and submucosa are univolved and the tumour expands the muscularis propria compartment displacing the native smooth muscle fibres.  The overlying gastro-oesophageal mucosais non-ulcerated, however in the distal oesophagus the surface is depressed and lined by attenuated stratified squamous epithelium showing reactive change, overlying a focus of granulation tissue; the appearances suggest regeneration overa prior ulcer.	PHI:Null
936	3985	The leiomyoma has a lobulated multinodular configuration with a main circumscribed nodule plus a few smaller adjacent nodules.

953	1868	A.  Specimen labelled "Right kidney and attached colon" consists of a kidney with attached perinephric fat and a section of colon.  The kidney measures 110 x 65 x 50mm.  There is a section of renal artery 30mm attached and there is a stump of ureter 15mm in length within the hilar tissue.  The cut surface of the kidney reveals a tan/golden/necrotic tumour measuring 28 x 25 x 22mm.  The tumour abuts the renal capsule and focally is seen to push the renal capsule into the perinephric fat.  The tumour appears to come within 2mm of this perinephric fat resection margin.  The tumour is 30mm from the hilar resection margin.  In the area where the tumour appears to push into the perinephric fat there is an area of fibrous/fat necrosis area within the perirenal fat which is adherent to a section of colon measuring 95mm in length.  No definite tumour is identified within this fibrous adherence.  The remainder of the renal parenchyma also appears unremarkable.  Multiple lymphnodes are identified within the mesenteric fat measuring from 2 to 5mm.  A further area of yellow/cream area is identified within the colonic mesenteric fat measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm ? fat necrosis.  In the same area there is a possible area of diverticulum within the colonic mucosa.	PHI:Null

953	3441	A.   Sections show a grade 3 papillary renal cell carcinoma with nucleoli easily identified (x10 objective). The tumour measures 28 x 25 x 22mm and is classified as a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma (the tumour cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm). There is no tumour necrosis.  The tumour invades through the renal capsuleinto perinephric fat and is focally present at the perinephric margin.  There is a fibrous adhesion between the tumour and the segment of colon and this dense fibrous adhesion contains scattered small tumour aggregates (T4 - beyond Gerota's fascia).	PHI:Null
953	3688	The tumour does not invade the renal hilum or pelvicalyceal system and there is no abnormality of the renal vessels or proximal ureter.  The kidney away from the tumour appears normal and one small uninvolved perinephric lymph node is identified.	PHI:Null
953	4026	The segment of colon shows no abnormality and the five small mesenteric lymph nodes identified are free of tumour. There is a focus of fat necrosis and dense fibrosis within the mesentery which also contains an occasional tumour aggregate.

The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue, the 9 o'clock margin black, deep margin green.  Specimen is serially sectioned from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock into fifteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock margin, slice fifteen 6 o'clock margin.  In slices five to nine there is a solid poorly defined white tan lesion measuring 40mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 40mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 30mm inmaximum thickness.  Macroscopically all the margins appear clear of tumour.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram.	PHI:Null

993	3060	B. Sections show skin with prominent solar elastosis excised to the level of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a 40mm malignant dermocutaneous tumour with similar morphology as that seen in the previous excision from Laverty Pathology (labelled 09-YANF 13231 Wyont, B 099051132; see also review report by Dr B Depung 09Y05113). The tumour is composed of sheets and short fascicles of pleomorphic spindled and epithelioid cells as well as malignant multinucleated cellswith bizarre, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures are prominent. The appearance is that of a malignant dermocutaneous tumour with features consistent with a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma shows invasion into underlying skeletal muscle but no connection to the epidermis is seen. No obvious lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.

993	4235	TEST DESCRIPTION	PHI:Null
993	4681	The sample was analysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]). Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation. This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.	PHI:Null
993	4709	RESULT NO MUTATION DETECTED	PHI:Null
993	4725	INTERPRETATION	PHI:Null
993	4876	No BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors.	PHI:Null
993	4885	Comments	PHI:Null
993	5512	BRAF mutations are foundin 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]. V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed toinhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients. Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]. The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].	PHI:Null

file1732	2399	Sections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.	PHI:Null

file1732	3605	The cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.	PHI:Null

The macroscopically described possible polyp is a zone of inspissated mucin mixed with mucosal fragments and cellular debris attached to the mucosal surface. The external surface of the bowel has an adherent strip of dense fibromuscular tissue, probably representing vessel wall, which pushes into the muscularis propria focally. It is associated with surrounding mesenteric fibrosis and it has an adherent organising blood clot. The vessel wall histology is altered by the fibrotic reaction. The blood clot extends into the wall of the bowel.  The mesenteric fat shows foreign body reaction to empty vacuoles and minimal suture material. There are two lymph nodes with no malignancy.

file21297	2991	A. Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of low-grade mucinous tumour. The distal appendiceal mucosa is replaced by mucinous epithelium characterised by mildly stratified basal columnar epithelial nuclei, apical cytoplasmic mucin, and flat to low villiform architecture. The mucosa is effaced, and in many areas, the mucinous epithelium rests on fibrotic tissue or muscularis propria. In the initial sections, there is a focal aggregate of organising mucin within the appendiceal fat. There is also focal mucin on the surface of the appendix which is not organising and is interpreted as surface contamination during specimen processing. There are no high-grade cytological or archictectural changes.	PHI:Null

file22205	4640	The appendix is involved in all areas by a low grade mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) forming a cystically dilated appendix mass. The LAMN shows fibrosis of the lamina propria and there is fibrosis and calcification of the appendix wall with lost of normal structures. The wall of the appendix is obliterated by penetrating mucin and neoplastic epithelium. There is extensive organising acellular mucin over the surface of the appendix. In two sections (4, 34), mucinous epithelium extends to the peritoneal surface of the appendix (pT4a).	PHI:Null

file23991	4931	Comment:  The large endometrial polyp contains foci of high grade serous carcinoma over the surface of the polyp and adjacent glands with small focal areas of adjacent stromal invasion in the polyp with focal lymphatic vascular invasion. Serous carcinoma is also seen within the adjacent endometrium of the fundus of the uterus where there is very focal early stromal/myometrial invasion (0.5mm, block 6). Serous carcinoma shows positivity for P53, WT1, P16, ER (20% 2-3+).  Additionally within the polyp there is background of a lower grade endometrioid carcinoma with mucinous differentiation, grade 2 which comprises about 75% of the tumour volume, with serous carcinoma about 20%. There is also a small focal area of more solid malignancy with increased mitoses which lies within the polyp and adjacent endometrium of the uterus within a 4mm area (&amp;lt;5% of the tumour, block 9). This small focus retains cytokeratin expression favouring a diagnosis of poorly differentiated/ de-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma.	PHI:Null

file26211	3531	The distal pancreas is entirely embedded and examined.  Within the distal tail of the pancreas there is a 10mm tumour composed of a moderately cellular arrangement of malignant spindle cells.  The spindle cells display predominately moderate but scattered highly pleomorphic forms with hyperchromatic vesicular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.  There are numerous mitoses including atypical forms.  The tumour has a fascicular arrangement arrangement and there are patchy areas of both hyalinisation and necrosis, involving about 20% of the tumour compatible with a treatment response.    The tumour has both an infiltrative as well as pushing border and at focally there is a thin fibrous pseudocapsule.  There are patchy areas of oedema and occasional vessels within the tumour show fibromyxoid intimal change compatible with previous treatment.  Apart from focal PanIN-1, the pancreatic parenchyma is unremarkable.  The tumour cells do not appear to arise from vessel walls.  The tumour is well clear of the pancreatic resection margin and appears confined to the pancreas.  The spleen is unremarkable and uninvolved.

file27158	2101	Specimen labelled &amp;quot;L thigh leiomyosarcoma - double stitch deep femoral vein, long stitch deep lateral, short stitch 12 o&amp;apos;clock&amp;quot;, consists of an oriented excision of soft tissue including skeletal muscle and overlying skin with three sutures denoting 12 o&amp;apos;clock, left lateral and deep femoral vein.  It is 100mm from superficial to deep, 64mm medial to lateral and 90mm from 12 o&amp;apos;clock to 6 o&amp;apos;clock (presumed superior to inferior).  The overlying skin is 90mm x 14mm and bears no focal lesions or scars.  The groove for the deep femoral vein is on the 9 o&amp;apos;clock aspect and is inked green, the 3 o&amp;apos;clock half of the margin is inked blue and the 9 o&amp;apos;clock half is inked black.  The suture indicating deep lateral lies on the 3 o&amp;apos;clock side.  Eight horizontal slices from 12 o&amp;apos;clock towards 6 o&amp;apos;clock show a 50 x 39 x 34mm circumscribed and firm lesion at the deep aspect of the specimen which has a pale cut surface with a central area of cystic degeneration and yellow softening and peripheral areas of red and brown discolouration (? haemorrhage).  The central softened areas (?necrosis) form approximately 40% of the cut surface.  The lesion abuts the deep aspect, the deep 3 o&amp;apos;clock (lateral) aspect and the (green inked) femoral vein groove, where there is a lumen consistent with vessel up to 4mm in diameter that appears surrounded by the lesion in some areas.  Perpendicular sections of the 12 o&amp;apos;clock end (slice 1) show the lesion is 5mm from the 12 o&amp;apos;clock soft tissue margin.

file27158	3699	Sections show, at the deep aspect of the specimen, a malignant spindle cell lesion with a relatively circumscribed but unencapsulated border, surrounded by fat and skeletal muscle. Tumour cells focally infiltrate into fibrous tissue between skeletal muscle bundles, particularly in the area of the femoral groove.  There is a central area of hyalinisation and necrosis (estimated to be approximately 40% of the tumour) and a peripheral zone of viable tumour that is composed of foci of small atypical spindle cells arranged in ill-formed fascicles with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei and medium sized nucleoli as well as prominent areas with markedly enlarged and bizarre cells with karyomegaly, smudged chromatin, multinucleation and prominent nucleoli.  These areas are associated with vascular proliferation, red cell extravasation and a mild lymphocytic infiltrate and would be consistent with treatment effect.  In the histologically viable areas there are up to 3 mitoses per 10 high power fields (block 4).  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen, though entrapped nerves are identified in the tumour mass.	PHI:Null
file27158	4086	The tumour is 0.2 mm from the deep aspect over several areas (blocks 5, lateral aspect and 9, central deep) and 0.2 mm from the femoral vein groove (blocks 2 and 8).

file27447	2519	A.  Sections of the pelvic mass show an atypical smooth muscle tumour with a small amount of overlying unremarkable squamous epithelium. The smooth muscle lesion is moderately to highly cellular with patchy moderate cytologic atypia (at low power) and brisk mitotic activity (up to 25 mitoses per 10 hpf). There are also several smooth foci of necrosis with features suggestive, but not definite, for coagulative necrosis. A focus of myxoid stromal change is also seen. Overall, the presence of cytologic atypia and brisk mitotic activity, is consistent with a smooth muscle tumour of uncertain malignant potential. However, given the presence of multiple foci of necrosis (?hyaline ?coagulative), as well as, patchy myxoid stromal change, a leiomyosarcoma cannot be entirely excluded.	PHI:Null

file28387	1945	C.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right retroperitoneum and right kidney; Suture short superior, loop renal vessels long lateral double loop deep margin&amp;quot;, consists of a kidney with surrounding retroperitoneal fat and other soft tissue, 230mm superior to inferior x 165mm medial to lateral x 84mm superficial to deep.  Superficial surface inked blue, deep black.  Total specimen weight 1238g.  Specimen received in formalin.  The kidney measures 125mm superior to inferior x 30mm medial to lateral x 45mm superficial to deep.  At the superior pole of the kidney are three subcapsular, unilocular cysts, the largest 30mm diameter.	PHI:Null
file28387	2853	Lateral to the kidney there is a circumscribed pale, cream coloured tumour measuring 65mm superior to inferior x 43mm medial to lateral x 40mm superficial to deep.  The tumour is 10mm from the lateral margin, 120mm from superior margin, 5mm from the inferior margin, 120mm from the medial margin, 3mm from the superficial and 3mm from the deep margin.  The tumour is within the peri-nephric fat and appears to be separate from the renal capsule.  It does not involve the kidney.  The fat immediately surrounding the circumscribed tumour is macroscopically unremarkable but elsewhere in the fat, away from the tumour, there are several circumscribed fatty nodules, up to 20mm diameter.  Two nodules are in the renal hilar region and abut soft tissue margins, and nodules elsewhere also abut excision margins.  Some adrenal tissue is identified adjacent to the postero-superior margin, measuring 22 x 3 x 3mm.	PHI:Null

file28387	3829	B.  Sections show liver tissue with a surface Von Meyenburg complex (biliary micro hamartoma).  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
file28387	4298	Adjacent liver tissue shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis.  This is non specific.  There is a mild and moderate, patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes and occasional eosinophils in portal tracts. There is no interface hepatitis.  Bile ducts appear normal.  There is mild fibrous expansion of portal tracts but there is no bridging fibrosis.  There is only very focal, mild lobular inflammation and no Mallory&amp;apos;s hyaline is identified.  Central veins are normal.	PHI:Null

file28387	4670	The mild and moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate in portal tracts are non-specific, but the presence of eosinophils raises the possibility of a drug reaction.	PHI:Null
file28387	5275	C.  Sections of the described circumscribed tumour mass lateral to the kidney show a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.  This consists of fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic, sometimes very large atypical nuclei.  Mitoses are frequent, numbering up to around 18 per ten high power fields.  There are small foci of fat within the tumour.  No heterologous elements are identified.  Much of the high grade tumour is circumscribed but there is some extension into the surrounding tissue and it is considered that high grade sarcoma extends to part of the lateral soft tissue margin focally (block C4).	PHI:Null
file28387	5892	Fat adjacent to the high grade tumour and elsewhere in the specimen, including most or all of the perinephric fat, is abnormal.  This shows features of an atypical lipomatous tumour / well differentiated liposarcoma, comprising mainly mature appearing fat with atypical stromal cells within fibrous septa.  The atypical cells have pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei.  This abnormal low grade tumour is seen surrounding renal vessels at the resection margin and surrounding the ureter at the resection margin.  Atypical lipomatous tumour appears to extend to, or abut, most or all excision margins of the specimen.	PHI:Null
file28387	6051	The atypical lipomatous tumour involves perinephric and other fat which appeared normal macroscopically, as well as the described circumscribed fatty nodules.	PHI:Null
file28387	6194	The appearances overall are of an atypical lipomatous tumour with component of high grade spindle cell sarcoma (dedifferentiated liposarcoma).	PHI:Null
file28387	6416	There is a separate small deposit of spindle cell tumour which is present at the deep excision margin in the inferior part of the specimen (block C10); this is considered to be a separate small focus of dedifferentiation.	PHI:Null
file28387	6523	There is some adrenal cortical tissue at the posterosuperior end of the specimen and this is unremarkable.	PHI:Null
file28387	7038	Sections of the cysts at the superior pole of the kidney show that these are lined by clear cells with low grade nuclei, and groups and cords of similar clear cells within septae between the cysts. Most of the tumour has features of a multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential but there is one more sheet-like solid area of tumour, 3mm diameter, consistent with clear cell renal cell carcinoma of conventional type (block C21).  There is no lymphovascular invasion or spread outside the kidney.	PHI:Null
file28387	7630	Also in the kidney there is a circumscribed papillary tumour with oncocytic features measuring 8mm diameter (block C19).  The tumour cells stain weakly positive for AMACR and also show some positive staining for epithelial membrane antigen but are vimentin negative.  Despite the fact that the tumour is only 8mm diameter the histologic features would be very unusual for a papillary adenoma and are favoured to be those of an oncocytic papillary renal cell carcinoma.  There is limited data about these tumours but there are thought to be low grade with infrequent recurrence or metastasis.	PHI:Null
file28387	7736	Sections of kidney elsewhere show features of mild benign nephrosclerosis but are otherwise unremarkable.	PHI:Null

file28788	2560	Sections of the left ovary show a multicystic tumour lined by intestinal type epithelium. Most of the epithelium is a single layer with relatively bland morphology; however there are foci of stratified epithelium and/or increased cytological atypia in more than 10% of the tumour. On immunohistochemistry CK7 is diffusely positive and CK20 shows patchy positivity. The features are consistent with a mucinous borderline tumour (atypical proliferative mucinous tumour).	PHI:Null
file28788	3123	The tumour is partly adherent to the myometrium without stromal reaction or other evidence of invasion.  Frank stromal invasion is not identified.   Sections of cervix include the transformation zone and show no significant abnormality. The myometrium shows numerous foci of adenomyosis.  The endometrium is inactive with areas of stromal decidualisation, consistent with progestational effect.  There is no evidence of endometritis or endometrial hyperplasia.  The right ovary and cervix show no significant abnormality.  The fallopian tubes are not identified.	PHI:Null

The margins appear clear and are as follows - 2mm from the posterior margin, 3mm from the anterior margin, and 2mm from the deep margin, well away from the superior and inferior margins.  The tumour also appears to arise from the overlying scar.  The lesion is all embedded.  Please see block diagram.	PHI:Null

file30453	2863	The specimen is entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of skin to subcutis with fascia and striated muscle at the deep aspect.  Expanding both the dermis and subcutis is a tumour with multinodular architecture.  Although part of the lesion appears pushing,  the tumour has significant infiltrative component at its periphery.  The tumour is composed of atypical spindle cell within background variable fibrus or myxoid stroma.  Cellularity is variable with moderately cellular areas corresponding to areas of less myxoid stroma, and relatively hypocellular areas associated with myxoid stroma.  Within the latter areas there are occasional curvilinear thin walled vessels.  There is variable nuclear pleomorphism with areas of nuclear enlargement of hyperchromasia admixed with spindle cells which are relatively bland, the latter especially seen at the tumour perimete. difficult.  Mitoses number up to 30 per 10 hpf and there is patchy necrosis.	PHI:Null
file30453	2873	Margins:	PHI:Null
file30453	3967	Assessing margins of clearance is extremely difficult because at its periphery  infiltrative tumour appears to merge with adjacent spindle cell scar tissue.  At the deep aspect the tumour mostly abuts the fascia and not penetrate it, however, focally relatively bland spindle cells, favoured to represent tumour, appear to penetrate the fascia and just reach the deep margin over a front of approximately 0.4mm (block 11).  Radially the tumour appears to extend outwards as thin bands within the plane of the subcutis as does organising scar.  Although apparently petering out towards the margins  and becoming less cellular, the  tumour appears to focally reach both the anterior and posterior radial margins (blocks 10, 12  and 7).  Patchy haemosiderin and neovascularisation is present amongst tumour cells.   Elsewhere along the anterior and posterior margin centrally within the specimen, the tumour appears to extend close to this margin but is probably clear.  Probable hypocellular tumour also reaches the inferior margin (block 16).  The superior margin appears clear by at least 5mm.	PHI:Null

file30728	5286	A.  Sections show grade 1endometrioid adenocarcinoma which essentially replaces the endometrium and endocervix.  The extent of the disease is such that the epicentre of the tumour cannot be determined.  A small amount of uninvolved ectocervix is present.   The carcinoma extends through the full thickness of the myometrium reaching 0.1mm from the serosal surface.  No definite tumour is seen on the serosal surface (Block A1).  The tumour invades endocervical- and ectocervical stroma reaching 4.5mm from the anterior vaginal cuff margin and 4.5mm from the posterior vaginal margin (A1 and A7) respectively.  Within the cervix the tumour  invades 20mm through a wall 23mm thick (block A7) while in the lower segment/uterine body it invades 20mm through a wall 20.6mm (block A8).  The tumour is composed of an admixture of endometrioid type glands lined by columnar cells with stratified elongated to round nuclei arranged in tubules or cribriform structures with patchy non-keratinising squamous differentiation (FIGO architecture grade1, nuclear grade 1, overall FIGO grade 1). This component shows variable mucinous differentiation with pathy intracytoplasmic apical mucin vacuoles as well intraluminal mucin.  A minor but significant portion of the tumour comprises smaller tubular/alveolar type mucinous glands  lined by cells with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin and peripheral displaced nuclei.  The two components are admixed and areas of  transition are also seen. Single cell differentiation is not seen.  The mucinous differentiation in both components is highlighted s on dPAS staining.  Focal surface hobnail-like morphology is also seen. There are foci of lymphovascular invasion (block A6) by tumour with mucinous features..  Perineural invasion is not identified. The ectocervical epithelium is completely denuded. The ectocervical epithelium is almost completely denuded; the residual epithelium does not show definite CIN.  The vaginal stratified squamous epithelium does not show evidence of VaIN.	PHI:Null

file30728	6193	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	PHI:Null

file30728	6346	COMMENT 2:	PHI:Null
file30728	7360	The features are those of an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with mucinous features and the PAX8 expression is consistent with a primary tumour. Some of the morphology features raise consideration of an endocervical rather than endometrial  primary. The epicentre of the tumour cannot be determined due to its extensive nature, replacing the endometrium and much of the cervix.  An in-situ component is also not identified.   The immunoprofile is conflicting;  the Vimentin negative, almost diffuse P16 expression is more typical of an endocervical primary while the strong diffuse ER (repeat stain pending) is more often seen in an endometrial primary.  Furthermore, this panel may not be reliable in distinguishing endometrial from endocervicial  origin as the tumour shows variant (mucinous) morphology and the panel is more reliable in tumours with classical morphology. Therefore an endometrial primary cannot be excluded.  Further correlation with the clinical features and previous pathology may be beneficial.	PHI:Null

The specimen has been previously opened with an anterior sagittal incision from cervix to fundus showing prot ruding tumour from the lumen.  The specimen weighs in total 155g.  The uterus measures up to 60mm from medial to lateral, 90mm from fundus to cervix and 45mm from anterior to posterior. The cervix has a blue discolouration.  It measures  35mm in diameter and appears unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 90mm in length and 7mm in external diameter. The right ovary measures up to 30x15x15mm.  The left fallopian tube measures up to 75mm in length and 7mm in ext ernal diameter and the left ovary measures up to 25x15x8mm.  The serosal surface of the uterus posteriorly shows some irregular pale areas ? tumour (inked red).  On further sectioning there is a pale polypoid tumour which measures up to  60x55x40mm and appears to invade with an irregular margin over 60% of the thickness of the myometrium (myometrial thickness appears to be 15mm at the fundus).  The tumour does not macroscopically extend into the lower uterine and cervi cal segment.  The tumour is centred on the posterior wall and approaches the right and left cornu.  The tumour appears to extend to the red inked serosal surface and the right lateral parametrial region.  On sectioning the ovaries are unr emarkable.	PHI:Null

file4096	4563	A.  Sections show high grade serous  endometrial adenocarcinoma.  Carcinoma is characterised by an exophytic polypoid intraluminal component, together with invasive carcinoma which extends through the full thickness of the wall of the uterus to form the posterior serosal sur face over a broad front. There is extensive lymphovascular space invasion, and focal small vessel invasion.  Non tumour endometrium shows atrophic features, and sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the right parametrium  show fragments of tumour within a thin walled vessel (presumed vein).  Sections of the bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.	PHI:Null
file4096	4657	B.  Sections show unremarkable fragments of omental fat. There is no evidence of  malignancy.	PHI:Null
file4096	4762	C.  Sections show a portion of fat.  There is no lymph node present. There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
file4096	5398	D.  The two fragments are somewhat crushed and characterised by focal mild to moderate diatherm y artefact.  Nonetheless, there is a surface proliferation together with infiltration by groups and single atypical cells characterised by pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei with a small to moderate amount of cytoplasm. The appearances are  highly suggestive of involved by serous carcinoma.  Immunstains show that the cells are positive for CK5/6, EMA, WT1, and HBME1 and negative for calretitin. The negative calretinin favours serous carcinoma. The remainder of stains may be  positive in mesothelial proliferations and serous carcinoma.	PHI:Null
file4096	5649	E.  Sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of involvement of the lymph node by high grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma virtually replaces the lymph node w ith focal probable extranodal spread. There is a smaller adjacent benign lymph node.	PHI:Null

Occasional small foci of necrosis are present.  There is a fibrous reactive stroma with some inflammatory cells around the periphery.  Immunostains show positivity for Cytokeratin 5/6, Cytokeratin 7, D2-40, WT1, Calretinin, HBME1 and EMA with negativity for Cytokeratin 20, TTF1, MOC31 and BEREP4, consistent with mesothelioma.

file5423	7238	A.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.	PHI:Null
file5423	8252	B.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI:Null

file5423	8927	C.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.	PHI:Null
file5423	10803	D.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.	PHI:Null

The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.	PHI:Null
file5423	12811	F.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.

file5423	14355	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
file5423	17345	The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr X Maino who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Rogelio comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.	DOCTOR:X Maino\nDOCTOR:Rogelio

Mucin tracks through the wall of the appendix onto the serosal surface. There are lakes of mucin towards the serosa which are lined by mucinous and columnar epithelium. The lakes contain a few small nests of low grade epithelial cells with scattered goblet cells. The nuclei are all low grade and and basal and range from small round nuclei to elongated cigar-shaped nuclei. The mucin lakes transect into the serosa of the terminal ileum and involve the serosal surface in this area. The proximal and distal right hemicolectomy resection margins are not involved.  Eight lymph nodes are identified including the apical lymph node which are all negative for malignancy.	PHI:Null

file7016	4342	A. Sections show of the macroscopically described polypoid exophytic lesion of the anterior cervix show a Mullerian adenosarcoma. The tumour is characterised by a mixture of benign appearing glands and malignant stroma. The glands are lined by endoecervical and tubal epithelium and characterised by mild architectural irregularities. The glands are surrounded by condensed hypercellular atypical stroma with features in keeping with a sarcomatous component. The sarcomatous component shows variable atypia, with at least some foci showing high-grade features characterised by moderate cellularity and nuclear pleomorphism with a mitotic rate of approximately 7/10 hpf. There is focal rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. There is no evidence of sarcomatous overgrowth.	PHI:Null
file7016	5085	The majority of the adenosarcoma is confined with a polyp. There are two foci favouring invasion of the wall of the cervix, to a maximum 2mm in a cervical wall thickness of 10mm (less than 50% involvement). The adenosarcoma has a maximum horizontal dimension of 20mm. There is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion. There is no evidence of involvement of the endometrium, and the adenosarcoma is well clear of the ectocervical margin and of the serosal surface. Immunostains show that the sarcomatoid component is positive for Desmin, and S100 in the area of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. The proliferative index (Ki67) is approximately 30%. Stains for Cam 5.2, AE1/AE3, CD31, CD34, CD117 and smooth muscle actin are negative.	PHI:Null
file7016	5372	Sections of the endometrium show secretory phase morphology. A leiomyoma is confirmed. There is no evidence of cellular atypia or of increased mitotic activity.

file9042	7229	A.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.	PHI:Null
file9042	8243	B.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI:Null

file9042	8918	C.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.	PHI:Null
file9042	10794	D.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.	PHI:Null

Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.	PHI:Null
file9042	12802	F.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.

file9042	14346	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
file9042	17337	The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr J Moniot who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Gonzalo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.	DOCTOR:J Moniot\nDOCTOR:Gonzalo
